1) Set up code so you can easily make idealised domains / boundary conditions

2) Fix boundary conditions -- impose critical flow for 'subcritical' type
boundaries if needed, and define a supercritical boundary. This will require
figuring out some mass conservation issues.

3) Test some analytical solutions

4) Figure out junctions

5) Look at the effect of reversing the reach orientation on the results.
    12/12/2012 -- Seems to have an effect at the boundaries. Nangka case had
    boundary artifacts with one orientation, none with the other. Both
    orientations had similar computed flow in channel interior. 
    However, my 'wet-dry' hacks are not guarenteed with reversal

6) Add a check to ensure that boundary conditions have been allocated etc -- otherwise we segfault!
